	<h1>Quality Assurance System</h1>
</a>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Quality module allows the users of WebERP to define what they would like to test, apply those tests
to certain templates or specific products (Items, Stocks) and then to capture actual test results on a Lot
to Lot or Serial number basis. Outputs from the module include a Product Specification or Data Sheet
and a Certificate of Analysis. Historical Results are kept and can be compared side by side for any
particular Item. There is an option in the configuration that allows QA Samples to be automatically
logged for Purchase Order and Work Order receipts if the product specification exists and the item is Lot
or Serial Controlled. Also in the configuration are some disclaimers for specifcations and certifications.</p>

<h2>QA Tests Maintenance</h2>
<p>This is where all tests that will be performed are defined. Other specification related information can be
captured here that isn’t tested but describes in more detail the product specification. An example of
this would be Processing Conditions for your product that you wish for your customers to understand.</p>

</p>
<ul>
	<li>Test Name: The name of the Test you are setting up.</li>
	<li>Method: ASTM, ISO, UL or other.</li>
	<li>Group By: Free Form. Can be used to Group certain Test on the Product Specification or Certificate of Analysis</li>
	<li>Units: How this is measure. PSI, Fahrenheit, Celsius etc.</li>
	<li>Type: How do we measure/Enter this value (Text, Date, Numeric Range, and Selection List?)</li>
	<li>Possible Values: (Only valid for type Select List, controls what appears in the drop down?)</li>
	<li>Numeric Value: Enforces numbers to be entered for this test type</li>
	<li>Show on Cert: Does this test print on the Certificate of Analysis (Can be overwritten at a Product level)</li>
	<li>Show on Cert: Does this test print on the Product Specification (Can be overwritten at a Product level)</li>
	<li>Show on Cert: Does this test print on the Test Plan (Can be overwritten at a Product level)</li>
	<li>Active: once a test has results entered against it delete is no longer allowed. This flag can be used to inactivate it and not use it on future product specifications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Product Specifications</h2>
<p>Product Specifications are a collection of QA Tests that come together to define how a Product Data
Sheet is built, what we test for and what we certify our results to. These are loosely tied to Items
(Stocks). If a Product Specification is named the same as a stock ID then the Product Description will be
used in printed paperwork and screens. If it is not a stock id then it is considered a generic product
specification that can be used to hold any type of test results in your system. This also allows cascading
templates to be created for faster product specification definition. In the future I foresee there may also
be a loose connection to Fixed Assets. A Product Specification is added as soon as a test is added to it.
To start a new specification, go to the Product Specification Screen, Type in a specification Name or
stock id and click Submit.</p>
